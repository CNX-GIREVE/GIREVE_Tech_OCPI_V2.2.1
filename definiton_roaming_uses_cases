# `CPO operation definition and naming rules`

A CPO operation is a homogeneous group of charging points. A CPO operation is defined by its unique eMI3 operation code also called “Operator Id” which is composed by a 2 ALPHA country code plus a 3 ALPHANUMERIC Spot Operator ID.

**Example: FR*AB1**

eMI3 standard official documentation can be downloaded here : <https://emi3group.com/documents-links/>


All EVSE included in each CPO operation must have an evse_id following the eMI3 standard naming rules defined in this specific document, page 27:

Specifically, all evse_id included into a given operation must always start with the Operator Id. 

**Example: FR*AB1*EABCDEFG*1**

#### Information and Requirements
-   It is not allowed to include in each CPO operation evse_ids starting with a different Operator-Id.
Example: A CPO “DE*CPO” having an “evse_id” not starting by “DECPO” or “DE*CPO” is not allowed
